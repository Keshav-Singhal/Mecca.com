# Mecca.com
Hi, I designed an E-Commerce Web Application (Mecca.com) with all functionalities ranging from selecting things in a cart to payment gateways using Django Framework and Python.

To run this project:

- Set up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
  - "python -m venv env"
  - "env\Scripts\activate  # On Windows"

- Check Database Migrations
  - "python manage.py makemigrations"
  - "python manage.py migrate"

- Run the Django Development Server
  - "python manage.py runserver"

Enjoy Shopping.
